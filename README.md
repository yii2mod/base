REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this application template that your Web server supports PHP 5.6


INSTALLATION
------------

## Installing using Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), follow the instructions in the
[Installing Yii](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/docs/guide/start-installation.md#installing-via-composer) section of the definitive guide to install it.

With Composer installed, you can then install the application using the following commands:

    composer create-project --prefer-dist --stability=dev yii2mod/base application

The first command installs the [composer asset plugin](https://github.com/francoispluchino/composer-asset-plugin/)
which allows managing bower and npm package dependencies through Composer. You only need to run this command
once for all. The second command installs the yii2mod/base application in a directory named `application`.
You can choose a different directory name if you want.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
After you install the application, you have to conduct the following steps to initialize
the installed application. You only need to do these once for all.

1) Init the application by the following command:
```bash
./init --env=Development
```

2) Create a new database and adjust the `components['db']` configuration in `config/common-local.php` accordingly.

3) Apply migrations:

- `php yii migrate` - create default tables for application
- `php yii rbac/migrate` - create roles, permissions and rules
- `php yii fixture "*"` - load fixtures (cms pages and users)

4) Set document root of your web server to `/path/to/application/web/` folder.


Installing using Docker
-----------------------

> You need to have [docker](http://www.docker.com) (1.10.0+) and
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (1.6.0+) installed.

You can install the application using the following commands:

```sh
composer create-project --no-install --stability=dev yii2mod/base yii2mod-base
cd yii2mod-base
./init --env=Development
cp .env{.dist,} && cp docker-compose.override.yml{.dist,}
docker-compose up -d --build
```
> In `.env` file your need to set your UID.
> You can get your UID by the following command in the terminal: `id -u <username>`

It may take some minutes to download the required docker images. When
done, you need to install vendors as follows:

```sh
docker-compose exec web bash
composer install
chown -R www-data:www-data runtime web/assets vendor
```

After this steps, you need to update `db` section in the `common-local.php` file as follows:
```php
<?php

$config = [
    'components' => [
        'db' => [
            'dsn' => 'mysql:host=db;dbname=yii2mod_base',
            'username' => 'docker',
            'password' => 'secret',
        ],
        'mailer' => [
            'useFileTransport' => true,
        ],
        'redis' => [
            'hostname' => 'redis',
        ],
    ],
];

return $config;
```

When done, you need to execute the following commands in the web container:
- `php yii migrate`
- `php yii rbac/migrate`
- `php yii fixture "*"`

After this steps, you can access your app from [http://localhost](http://localhost).

TESTING
-------

Tests are located in `tests` directory. They are developed with [Codeception PHP Testing Framework](http://codeception.com/).
By default there are 3 test suites:

- `unit`
- `functional`
- `acceptance`

### Running tests

1. Create a new database and configure database connection in `config/test_db.php` accordingly.
2. Execute migrations by the following command:
      - `./yii_test migrate --interactive=0 && ./yii_test rbac/migrate --interactive=0`
3. Run unit and functional tests:
```
bin/codecept run
``` 

The command above will execute unit and functional tests. Unit tests are testing the system components, while functional
tests are for testing user interaction. Acceptance tests are disabled by default as they require additional setup since
they perform testing in real browser. 


### Running  acceptance tests

To execute acceptance tests do the following:  

1. Rename `tests/acceptance.suite.yml.example` to `tests/acceptance.suite.yml` to enable suite configuration

2. Replace `codeception/base` package in `composer.json` with `codeception/codeception` to install full featured
   version of Codeception

3. Update dependencies with Composer 

    ```
    composer update  
    ```

4. Download [Selenium Server](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) and launch it:

    ```
    java -jar ~/selenium-server-standalone-x.xx.x.jar
    ``` 

5. Start web server:

    ```
    ./yii_test serve
    ```

6. Now you can run all available tests

   ```
   # run all available tests
   bin/codecept run

   # run acceptance tests
   bin/codecept run acceptance

   # run only unit and functional tests
   bin/codecept run unit,functional
   ```

### Code coverage support

By default, code coverage is disabled in `codeception.yml` configuration file, you should uncomment needed rows to be able
to collect code coverage. You can run your tests and collect coverage with the following command:

```
#collect coverage for all tests
bin/codecept run -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml

#collect coverage only for unit tests
bin/codecept run unit -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml

#collect coverage for unit and functional tests
bin/codecept run functional,unit -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml
```

You can see code coverage output under the `tests/_output` directory.
